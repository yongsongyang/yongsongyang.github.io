### About Me

Hi! Here is Yongsong Yang (Casey, 杨永松). Currently, I'm a research assistant at [GairLab](https://metaslam.github.io/). Prior to this, I worked as a Vehicle Integration Engineer at [BYD](https://www.bydglobal.com/en/index.html) for two years. I received my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Quanqing Yu](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/YUQUANQING), and my bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering from [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/) in 2021.
You can find my [CV](https://yongsongyang.github.io/file/CV-YongsongYang.pdf) here.
